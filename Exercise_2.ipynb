    "# Exercise 2\n",
    "This exercise has the goal to determine ASes that are using the RPKI to perform Route-Origin-Validation (ROV) and filter invalid announcements. \n",
    "\n",
    "An invalid announcement is a BGP announcement that has a ROA covering the announced prefix space, but the Origin AS announcing the prefix is not contained in any covering ROA, therefore rendering the announcement invalid. This could be a possible hijack or a misconfiguration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology: We announce an anchor prefix 147.28.240.0/24 which is always validating to valid. We also announce an experiment prefix 147.28.241.0/24 which is invalid between 04-12 UTC, else valid. Therefore, we are able to observe route changes/missing routes for the experiment prefix once the valitity status changes.\n",
